This is an application that connects PostgreSQL and MongoDB. You can use "insert", "update" and "delete" in PostgreSQL, and see the corresponding "insert", "update" and "delete" in your MongoDB.

Please make sure your connection urls in PostgreSQL and MongoDB are correct before you run the server_repl.py and client_repl.py

The default connection to PostgreSQL is localhost, please line24 in client_repl.py to your own "username" and "password", and follow the following steps:



the directory architectures are:

assignment
  -- assignment1 
     -- client
	-- client_repl.py
     -- server
	-- server_repl.py
     -- README
     -- Pipfile
     -- photos
	-- helloworld.proto



1. Go to server/ and run : python server_repl.py


2. Open the other terminal, go to client/ run : python client_repl.py "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster1.sinps.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

Replace <username> with the username for you, and replace <password> with the password for the user. Replace myFirstDatabase with the name of the database that connections will use by default. Ensure any option params are URL encoded.

If you meet any problem, please contact yuche.lin@sjsu.edu for more information. Thank you.


Note1: Don't forget the Double quotes when you run the client_repl.py 
Note2: The max_replication_slots is default to 10 slots. If you exceed the number of maximum replication slots, please free one or increase max_replication_slots. To free replication slot, use "select pg_drop_replication_slot(â€˜your_replication_slot_name');"
Note3: You can modify the replication_slot name in line27 in the client_repl.py
